# Sidebar CSS

This stylesheet repositions H2 and H3 headers into the left margin. It is good for simple text-only documents with lots of small sections, such as class handouts.

This is intended to be used with markdown-generated HTML. The current version, however, does not yet properly support all of the tags and layouts that markdown can be used to create.

Naturally this layout is not suited to small screen widths. Currently it is not responsive and simply fails if the screen is too narrow.

## Use

Use second level headings to place a heading in the margin. Use third level headings to add an arrow in front of this, ie:

>   Heading 2  
> â†’ Heading 3

## Examples

See `/examples` for an example documents in markdown and html format, and for the original PDF on which they were based.
